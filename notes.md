alias.s=status
alias.l=log --all --graph --decorate --oneline --pretty=format:'%C(bold 
red)%d%Creset %cr %C(bold yellow)%h%Creset - %C(green)%an%Creset %s'
pull.rebase=true
core.editor=code



-readme.md: Use to describe modifications and alterations you make to 
startup.
-notes.md: track what you have learned. will be used for the midterm/final

Fork: Create a copy of a github repository. Maintains a link to the original 
repository so you can pull down updates.

**1/19: EC2**

**1/22: Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, and certificates**
Caddy
web service that listens for HTTP requests. Once received, it either gives the requested static files or routes the files to another web service (gateway/reverse proxy)
creation/rotation of web certificates
serves all static HTML/CSS/JS

FILES
Configuration file: ~/Caddyfile: for routing HTTP requests, determine location of HTML files,etc. Don’t change.
HTML files: ~/public_html: directory of files that Caddy servers up when requests are made
ex: request http://yourdomainname/index.html looks for index.html in public_html

HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates
HTTPS: HTTP with negotiated secure connection that happens before data is exchanged. All data encrypted w TLS protocol (negotiate shared secret and use to encrypt)
negotiation includes exchange of web certificate that identifies the dns of the server creating the server connection. Browser makes sure that certificate name matches domain name in URL.

Web Certificates
generated by 3rd party using private key encryption
once you have certificate for domain name, browser can validate
Let’s encrypt lets you make a web certificate for free.
Caddy: uses lets encrypt to generate a web certificate every time a HTTPS request is made for a domain that Caddy doesn’t have a certificate for. It then asks lets encrypt to verify that the domain is owned by the requester

curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null //see the negotiation that happens

EDIT Caddy configuration:
cd ~
vi Caddyfile
i //then make changes
esc
:wq + enter
sudo service caddy restart
