# Taste Trove #
## Description deliverable ##

### Elevator Pitch ###

Do you like cooking or baking? Do you wish you had access to your friends and family’s cookbook recipes? My application, Taste Trove, allows users to post recipes and see those posted by others. Once signed in, scroll through mouth watering recipes till you find one that fits your tastes. Use the number of 'makes' on a recipe to see what is most popular. Click the 'add recipe' button to share one of your own.

### Technologies ###
I will use the required technologies in the following ways:

- HTML: Three HTML pages using the proper HTML structure. One for login, one for the user’s recipes, one for all recipes.

- CSS: Attractive design that works for different screen size. Scroll through recipes.

- JavaScript: Login, adding/deleting recipes, 'making' recipes

- Service: Login, Retrieving
  
- Database/Login: Persisted app and auth data
  - Sign in to your own account.
  - Users
  - Who posted each recipe
  - Recipes
  - ‘Makes’ on a recipe

- WebSocket: Users can see each other's recipes and see how many times a recipe has been ‘made’.

- React: Will be properly used to wrap the previous things in a better design.
