Elevator Pitch
Do you like cooking or baking? Do you wish you had access to your friends and family’s recipes? My application, Taste Trove, will allow users to post recipes and see those posted by others. Scroll through mouth watering recipes till you find one that fits your tastes. Use the number of ‘makes’ on a recipe to see which is the most popular. Add a recipe of your own in minutes!

I will use the required technologies in the following ways:

CSS - Attractive design that works for different screen size. Scroll through recipes.

JavaScript - Login, adding/deleting recipes, making recipes, 

Service - Web service endpoints

Retrieving 

Database/Login - Persisted app and auth data
Sign in to your own account.

WebSocket - Users can see each other's recipes and see how many times a recipe has been ‘made’.

React - Web framework: Will be properly used to wrap the previous things in a better design.
