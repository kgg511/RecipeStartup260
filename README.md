### Elevator Pitch ###

Do you like cooking or baking? Do you wish you had access to your friends and family’s cookbook recipes? My application, Taste Trove, allows users to post recipes and see those posted by others. Once signed in, scroll through mouth watering recipes till you find one that fits your tastes. Use the number of 'makes' on a recipe to see what is most popular. Click the 'add recipe' button to share one of your own.
